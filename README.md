## Installation
The code should run with no issue with Anaconda3, with xgboost installed 

## Project Motivation
Periodically Starbucks will send different offers that might be advertisement, discount or buy one get one free (BOGO) to different customers, and not all users receive the same offers. The business question people most interested in is: which groups of people are most responsive to each type of offer (BOGO, Discount, Informational) sent out by Starbucks? If this is predictable, Starbucks could just send the offer to people who are most likely to reponse to save resources.

In this capstone project, I am using the data simulating customer behavior in the Starbucks reward mobile app, provided by Udacity as part of the Data Scientist Nanodegree to answer the above business question.

## File Descriptions
There is one notebooks available to show work related to the above business question. The notebooks is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions above. Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.

The three json files are the data provided by Udacity for the analysis

## Results
The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@sul_91968/prediction-for-effective-offers-using-starbucks-mobile-reward-app-data-a0fd081840bd).
